Epic A: Image Occlusion UI Completion
- Backend is 100% done, frontend is placeholder
- Critical for nursing students (anatomy diagrams, drug mechanisms, lab values)
- Scope: Canvas editor for drawing regions, display in focus mode
- Risk: Canvas/drawing UI is complex, could take 2-3 weeks alone

Epic B: Dashboard & Analytics (Best-in-Class)
- Current home page is empty placeholder
- Features: study streaks, heatmaps, retention curves, time studied, card state breakdowns, forecast
- LayerChart already referenced in codebase (Svelte 5 compatible)
- High visibility, high motivation for users

Epic C: Mobile PWA Polish
- Mission says "mobile-first" but no mobile-specific testing done
- Touch interactions, offline capability, install prompts, responsive layouts
- Nursing students study on phones between clinical rotations

Epic D: Curated Fact Libraries (Shared Decks)
- New feature: browse/import pre-made high-quality fact sets
- Could launch with 1-2 nursing decks (anatomy basics, vital signs, common meds)
- Differentiator: "content + tool" vs just tool
- Requires: library browsing UI, copy-to-notebook flow, content creation pipeline

Epic E: Review History & Session Insights UI
- Backend complete, no frontend
- Shows users their learning journey (what they reviewed, how they rated, trends)
- Feeds into dashboard goal, relatively low complexity
